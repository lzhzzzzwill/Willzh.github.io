Hello, my name is Zuhong Lin, and I am currently a lecturer at the **School of Resources and Environment, Hunan University of Technology and Business**. I completed my undergraduate and master’s studies at Nanchang Hangkong University and Beijing University of Chemical Technology, respectively, and received my Ph.D. degree in Engineering from Central South University.

My research focuses on applying artificial intelligence to solve challenges in environmental and chemical engineering. I’m particularly interested in combining data-driven approaches with domain knowledge to design sustainable materials and processes. I’m passionate about interdisciplinary collaboration and always eager to explore how intelligent technologies can contribute to a cleaner and more efficient future.

Research Area
======
My research interests focus on the application of deep learning and large language models (LLMs) in metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) for environmental and energy-related applications, with particular emphasis on:
- Data-driven modeling and intelligent screening of MOFs
Developing deep learning models to learn structure–property relationships and enable efficient screening and performance prediction of MOFs.
- LLM-assisted understanding and automation of MOF synthesis
Applying large language models to extract, organize, and reason over MOF synthesis knowledge from the scientific literature, supporting automated and reproducible research workflows.
- Design and application of MOF-based functional materials
Synthesizing and applying MOFs for gas adsorption, pollutant separation, and advanced oxidation processes (AOPs), with the goal of achieving high-performance materials for environmental remediation.

Overall, my research aims to bridge artificial intelligence with experimental materials science, enabling efficient discovery, synthesis, and deployment of high-performance MOFs for sustainable environmental technologies.

Getting started
======
- I actively participate in the GitHub, Hugging Face, and ResearchGate communities, where I’m passionate about exploring and staying up to date with others’ work in the field.
