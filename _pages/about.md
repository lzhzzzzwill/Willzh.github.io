Hello, my name is Zuhong Lin, and I am currently a full-time teacher at the **School of Resources and Environment, Hunan University of Technology and Business**. I completed my undergraduate and master‚Äôs studies at Nanchang Hangkong University and Beijing University of Chemical Technology, respectively, and received my Ph.D. degree in Engineering from Central South University.

My research focuses on applying artificial intelligence to solve challenges in environmental and chemical engineering. I‚Äôm particularly interested in combining data-driven approaches with domain knowledge to design sustainable materials and processes. I‚Äôm passionate about interdisciplinary collaboration and always eager to explore how intelligent technologies can contribute to a cleaner and more efficient future.

Research Area
======
Specifically, I am passionate about leveraging *machine learning (ML), particularly deep learning*, to uncover the relationship between *metal‚Äìorganic frameworks (MOFs)* and *pollutant removal*. My goal is to use these insights to efficiently screen, design, and synthesize high-performance MOFs‚Äîwhat I like to call ***‚Äúperformance monsters‚Äù***‚Äîfor environmental remediation.
Ôªø
During my graduate studies, my research focused on arsenic, a toxic heavy metal that poses a serious threat to human health. The World Health Organization sets the allowable arsenic concentration in drinking water at 10 ppb, yet many regions in northern China still suffer from levels far exceeding this limit. Motivated by this pressing issue, I have designed a series of MOFs and other functional materials for arsenic removal using a combination of trial-and-error synthesis, machine learning models, and theoretical analysis.

Beyond material discovery, I am also deeply interested in the automation of scientific workflows. I developed a suite of agents powered by large language models (LLMs) to extract MOF synthesis methods directly from scientific literature. This end-to-end pipeline, which I call **MOFh6**, serves as a ***‚Äúdragon-searching ruler‚Äù***‚Äîa tool capable of parsing complex text, extracting synthesis knowledge, querying MOF structural data, retrieving crystallographic information files, and even visualizing crystal structures.

Looking ahead, I plan to expand my research into broader application areas of MOFs, including *advanced oxidation processes*, *atmospheric water harvesting*, and *gas separation*. Ultimately, I hope to contribute to sustainable environmental technologies and support China‚Äôs dual carbon goals through intelligent materials design.

Getting started
======
- I actively participate in the GitHub, Hugging Face, and ResearchGate communities, where I‚Äôm passionate about exploring and staying up to date with others‚Äô work in the field.
