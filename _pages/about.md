Hello, my name is Zuhong Lin, and I am currently a full-time teacher at the **School of Resources and Environment, Hunan University of Technology and Business**. I completed my undergraduate and master’s studies at Nanchang Hangkong University and Beijing University of Chemical Technology, respectively, and received my Ph.D. degree in Engineering from Central South University.

My research focuses on applying artificial intelligence to solve challenges in environmental and chemical engineering. I’m particularly interested in combining data-driven approaches with domain knowledge to design sustainable materials and processes. I’m passionate about interdisciplinary collaboration and always eager to explore how intelligent technologies can contribute to a cleaner and more efficient future.

Research Area
======
Specifically, I am passionate about leveraging *machine learning (ML), particularly deep learning*, to uncover the relationship between *metal–organic frameworks (MOFs)* and *pollutant removal*. My goal is to use these insights to efficiently screen, design, and synthesize high-performance MOFs—what I like to call ***“performance monsters”***—for environmental remediation.
﻿
During my graduate studies, my research focused on arsenic removal, a toxic heavy metal that poses a serious threat to human health. The World Health Organization sets the allowable arsenic concentration in drinking water at 10 ppb, yet many regions in northern China still suffer from levels far exceeding this limit. Motivated by this pressing issue, I have designed a series of MOFs and other functional materials for arsenic removal using a combination of trial-and-error synthesis, machine learning models, and theoretical analysis.

Beyond material discovery, I am also deeply interested in the automation of scientific workflows. I developed a suite of agents powered by large language models (LLMs) to extract MOF synthesis methods directly from scientific literature. This end-to-end pipeline🤖, which I call **MOFh6**, serves as a ***“dragon-searching ruler📏”***—a tool capable of parsing complex text, extracting synthesis knowledge, querying MOF structural data, retrieving crystallographic information files, and even visualizing crystal structures.

Looking ahead, I plan to expand my research into broader application areas of MOFs, including *advanced oxidation processes*, *atmospheric water harvesting*, and *gas separation*. Ultimately, I hope to contribute to sustainable environmental technologies and support nation’s dual carbon goals through intelligent materials design.
